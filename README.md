# Dsc-Phase5-Project

This is a climatrack data driven pipeline for weather applications.

# CLIMATRACK - INTELLIGENT WEATHER AND CLIMATE FORECASTING
## PROJECT OVERVIEW
ClimaTrack is a big data-driven platform designed to analyze weather patterns and climate trends. It provides users with localized weather data, AI-powered forecasts, and climate reports to help them stay informed.

By entering a location, users can access real-time weather information, while AI predictions offer insights into future conditions. The platform also forecasts extreme weather events and anomalies to help users prepare for disruptions.

Powered by data from NOAA and trusted weather APIs, ClimaTrack delivers accurate, up-to-date insights for individuals, researchers, and policymakers. The goal of ClimaTrack is to empower users with precise, data-driven insights to better understand and respond to weather and climate changes, enhancing decision-making and preparedness.

# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
In this project, we are trying to answer the following questions:

How can ClimaTrack provide highly localized and accurate weather forecasts to help users make more informed decisions about daily activities and long-term planning? How can ClimaTrack leverage advanced AI predictions to improve understanding and preparedness for climate anomalies and extreme weather events? How can ClimaTrack offer tailored climate insights to support the needs of individuals, researchers, and policymakers in a world increasingly impacted by climate change?

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
As climate change accelerates, there is a growing need for accurate, localized weather data, climate reports, and predictions about extreme weather events. Existing solutions often fail to provide granular forecasts or predictions related to climate anomalies. ClimaTrack seeks to fill this gap by offering detailed insights into weather patterns and climate events, empowering users to make data-driven decisions and better prepare for environmental changes.

# OBJECTIVES
Develop a scalable ETL pipeline to ingest, process, and analyze large-scale weather data from NOAA and weather APIs.

Implement machine learning models to predict localized weather trends and extreme weather events.

Provide interactive reports and visualizations for users to understand long-term climate trends and short-term weather anomalies.

Enable user-friendly access to customized weather analytics based on location inputs.

# STAKEHOLDERS
*Individuals*: Personalized weather insights and extreme weather alerts.

*Businesses & Agriculture*: Seasonal weather trend analysis for operational planning.

*Researchers & Environmentalists*: Access to detailed climate change trends and predictive models.

*Government & Disaster Management Agencies*: Proactive strategies for mitigating climate risks.

# USE CASES AND APPLICATIONS
*Personalized Weather Insights and Alerts*: Provide individuals with localized weather forecasts and real-time extreme weather alerts, helping them plan daily activities and safeguard against disruptions.

*Operational Planning for Businesses & Agriculture*: Deliver seasonal weather trend analysis that aids in strategic decision-making, optimizing resources, and adjusting operations based on anticipated weather patterns.

*Climate Change Research and Predictive Modeling*: Enable researchers and environmentalists to access historical climate data and predictive models, facilitating deep analysis of climate change trends and supporting informed policy-making.

*Climate Risk Mitigation for Government & Disaster Management*: Offer government agencies and disaster management teams the tools to develop proactive climate risk strategies, improve preparedness, and manage potential climate-related disasters more effectively.

# CLIMATRACK'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
What sets climatarck apart from other solutions in the market is:

*Hyper-Localized Analysi*s: Unlike conventional weather apps, ClimaTrack provides location-specific trends rather than broad regional estimates.

*AI-Powered Anomaly Detection*: Machine learning enhances extreme weather event predictions beyond standard meteorological models.

*Seamless Integration*: The system can integrate with other applications via APIs for broader use cases in agriculture, insurance, and emergency response.

*Real-Time and Historical Data Access*:Users can compare historical patterns with real-time data to identify long-term trends.

# DATA UNDERSTANDING
In this project we will utilize various weather data sources to build a weather forecasting and anomaly detection system. Below is an overview of each data component:

*NOAA Datasets*: - Provides historical climate data, including temperature, precipitation, and other environmental factors, forming the foundation for model training and trend analysis.

*Third-Party Weather APIs (OpenWeather, AccuWeather, WeatherStack)*: - Delivers real-time and forecasted weather data, enhancing the accuracy of predictions and supporting dynamic forecasting capabilities.

*ETL Process*: - Extracts raw data from the aforementioned sources, transforms it by cleaning and normalizing the data, and loads it into a cloud-based database for efficient storage and access.

*Machine Learning Models*: - Trained on historical weather data to predict future conditions and detect anomalies, leveraging patterns in the climate data to improve forecast reliability.

*Visualization & Reporting*: - Provides user-friendly dashboards, graphs, and customized climate trend reports for easy interpretation of weather patterns and anomalies.

# Anomaly Detection in Time Series Using Isolation Forest

## Overview
This project implements an anomaly detection system for time series data using the **Isolation Forest** algorithm. The model is designed to detect anomalies in time-dependent data by assigning probability scores to data points based on their likelihood of being anomalies.

## Why Isolation Forest?
Isolation Forest is an effective and efficient algorithm for anomaly detection, particularly for time series data. It works by randomly selecting features and splitting data points recursively until anomalies (which require fewer splits to be isolated) are detected. This method is computationally efficient and does not assume an underlying statistical distribution, making it well-suited for diverse time series datasets.

### Advantages:
- **Scalability**: Works well on large datasets.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Does not require labeled data.
- **Robust to Noise**: Effectively isolates outliers without being heavily affected by noisy data.
- **Interpretability**: Provides anomaly scores, which can be converted into probabilities.

## Implementation Details
The implementation follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Generates or loads time series data.
   - Injects anomalies to test model performance (if working with synthetic data).
   
2. **Feature Normalization**
   - Normalizes the data using MinMax scaling to improve model performance.

3. **Model Training**
   - Uses the `IsolationForest` algorithm from `sklearn.ensemble`.
   - Fits the model on the time series data to learn normal patterns.

4. **Anomaly Score Calculation**
   - The model assigns anomaly scores to data points.
   - Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of an anomaly.

5. **Probability Estimation**
   - Converts raw anomaly scores into probability values using a logistic function.
   - This provides a more interpretable measure of how anomalous a point is.

6. **Visualization & Analysis**
   - Plots the time series data with detected anomalies highlighted.
   - Helps in understanding model performance and tuning parameters.

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python anomaly_detection.py
   ```
3. Observe the visualization to analyze detected anomalies.

## Future Enhancements
- **Support for real-time streaming data** using frameworks like Apache Kafka.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** for improved accuracy.
- **Integration with forecasting models** for predictive anomaly detection.

This implementation provides a robust starting point for anomaly detection in time series data using Isolation Forest, offering insights into abnormal patterns in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and IoT monitoring.

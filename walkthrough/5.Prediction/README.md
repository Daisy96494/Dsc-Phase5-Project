# NVAR Weather Prediction Model

## Overview
The **NVAR (Nonlinear Vector AutoRegressive) Weather Prediction Model** is a time-series forecasting model designed to predict weather variables using past observations. It leverages **nonlinear feature expansion** combined with **ridge regression** to capture complex dependencies in weather data.

This model is well-suited for forecasting meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed by learning patterns from historical data and generating future predictions.

## Why NVAR for Weather Forecasting?
Traditional linear forecasting models, like ARIMA, struggle with capturing nonlinear dependencies in weather patterns. NVAR enhances predictive performance by:

- **Expanding the feature space** with nonlinear transformations (e.g., polynomial terms, interaction features).
- **Maintaining efficiency** by using ridge regression for fast and stable training.
- **Handling multivariate time-series data**, allowing simultaneous prediction of multiple weather parameters.
- **Providing interpretability**, as nonlinear transformations offer insights into the relationships between weather variables.

## Implementation Details
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- The input dataset consists of time-series weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed).
- Missing values are handled via interpolation or statistical imputation.
- Data is normalized for better model stability and accuracy.

### 2. Feature Expansion (Nonlinear Transformation)
- Polynomial and interaction features are generated based on past values to capture nonlinear trends.
- These expanded features serve as input for the predictive model.

### 3. Training the Ridge Regression Model
- The transformed dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- Ridge regression is used to train the model, preventing overfitting via L2 regularization.
- The model learns relationships between past and future weather variables.

### 4. Prediction & Evaluation
- The trained model forecasts future values for each weather variable.
- Performance is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), normalized for better comparability.
- Forecasts are visualized to assess prediction accuracy and trends.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib
   ```
2. **Prepare weather data** in CSV format with columns like `timestamp`, `temperature`, `humidity`, etc.
3. **Run the model script** to train and generate predictions:
   ```sh
   python nvar_weather_prediction.py
   ```
4. **Visualize results**: The script generates plots to illustrate predicted vs. actual weather trends.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with **real-time weather APIs** (e.g., OpenWeather, NOAA) for continuous forecasting.
- Extension to **spatial weather modeling** for regional climate analysis.
- Hybrid models combining **NVAR with deep learning techniques** for improved accuracy.

## Conclusion
The NVAR Weather Prediction Model provides a **fast, interpretable, and effective** solution for forecasting weather variables. By leveraging **nonlinear transformations and ridge regression**, it captures intricate weather patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. This implementation serves as a solid foundation for **advanced weather analytics and anomaly detection**.
